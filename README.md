# EM-wave-propogation-through-tissues
In this project, I analysed the passing of electromagnetic (EM) waves through body tissue, which can provide valuable insights and applications in the biomedical field. This area of study, often referred to as bioelectromagnetics, has led to various advances and potential benefits for healthcare and medical research.
